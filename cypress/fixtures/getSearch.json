The show premiered in the UK on E4 on 17 September 2008 and in January 2010 on Virgin 17 in France.\n\nAfter the first season aired, Logo renewed the program for a second season, which debuted on November 11, 2008.\n\nThe animation of the original Rick & Steve shorts were done using Lego blocks and figures, prompting a lawsuit from the company. Though the series no longer uses Lego blocks, it still draws comparison to both them and those by Playmobil.\n\nIt is produced by Toronto-based production studio, Cuppa Coffee Studio. Currently, there are no further plans for a third season of Rick & Steve.",
